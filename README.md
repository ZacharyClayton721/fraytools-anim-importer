# Fraytools Animation Importer
This program allows you to import animations into a Fraytools projects via two separate methods.
# Folder Import
This version of the animation importer takes a series of organized folders and creates animations based off those folders. This is the primary use for all non-Mugen projects. The support for this version is currently lacking but there will be a revamp very soon. This method is currently reserved for advanced users of the tool.
# Mugen Import
This version is the main version to use for Fraytools. Utilizing the .air file of a Mugen project, this tool extracts all of the relative information for animations. This includes hurtboxes and hitboxes along with sprites. Another feature for the Mugen importer is the option to import palettes, however they currently are not well supported. Palette code will be updated at a later date for full support.
